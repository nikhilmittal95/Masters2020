I got the dataset from Kaggle Website. I choose this topic because I wanted to see and get answers through visualizations which
 regions, country, and the attack types are done that are affecting the world from a period of 1970-2017. 


Firstly, I created a "Line Graph" which depicts the number of kills from the year 1970-2020 and the line is plotted for various regions around the world 
From the visualization, it can be seen that Middle East & North Africa region and Sub-Saharan region were the most affected regions in the terms of number of killings 
after 2010.

For the second graph, I Created a "Treemap" which shows yearly killings in a country after the year 2000.
from the visualization, it can be seen that the most affected countries from terrorism after the year 2000 are Iraq and Afghanistan which have the most number of killings. 
And we can see in the line graph visualization, The middle east region is most affected by terrorism and Iraq falls Under That.
We can filter the years from the right side to get a particular number of killings for that year and for a specific country. Example if we select the  year 2001,
 The United States has the most killings because in that year 9/11 attacks happened.


And lastly, I created a "Word Cloud" that visualizes what were the attack types in th4ese terrorist activities.
 The most number of killings for a particular attack type which can be seen as which text is bigger is Armed Assault then Bombing /Explosion and then hostage(kidnapping).


Thank you so much for Listening.
